The Netdata team welcomes contributions to its open-source tools and projects. Let's get you started on the right path.

First, read the [contributing handbook](/contribute/handbook) for high-level information about how the Netdata team
welcomes contributors and their work. Read our [community code of conduct](/contribute/code-of-conduct) for information
about how the Netdata team aims to create a welcoming environment free from harassment or discrimination.

## Contribute to Netdata's open-source projects

We maintain an [index of open-source projects](/contribute/projects) that welcome contributions from anyone interested.

The standards from our handbook and code of conduct apply to all of Netdata's open-source repositories.

## Contribute to documentation

We have a specific guide for [contributing to Netdata's documentation](/contribute/documentation).

You should also read our [style guide](/contribute/style-guide) for standards around spelling, grammar, and Markdown
syntax.

## Package maintainers

See our document on [manually building Netdata from source](/docs/agent/packaging/installer/methods/source) for details
about how you can build Netdata, including all of its dependencies and features, and package in for your distribution.
