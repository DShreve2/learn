Invite new users by clicking on your Space's name in the top navigation, and then **Invite more users**, to open the
invitation modal.

Repeat the process with everyone you want to invite to your Space.

When you're ready to send the new invitations you created, hit the **Send** button. Netdata Cloud sends these
invitations as soon as it can and moves them to the **Invitations awaiting response** category.

Your team will receive their invitations momentarily and prompt them to [sign in](/docs/cloud/manage/sign-in) to join
your Space.
