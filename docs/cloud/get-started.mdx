This guide will help you get started with Netdata Cloud by walking you through the onboarding and claiming process.

🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
For those migrating from the 

## Before you start

Make sure to update your Agent(s) by going to your Netdata dashboard and clicking **Update** or **Update Now** in the
top navigation. The modal will tell you whether your Agent is up-to-date or not. 

> ⚠️ Netdata Cloud requires an Agent with v1.22 or higher.

If you need to update, read the [updating documentation](/docs/agent/packaging/installer/update/) for information on how
to update based on the method you used to install that Agent.

## Begin the onboarding process

Navigate to Netdata Cloud either by clicking the **Sign in** button in a dashboard's top navigation, or by visiting
[https://app.netdata.cloud](https://app.netdata.cloud).

The Authentication screen asks you to sign in via Google, GitHub, or email. Choose your preferred method. Once signed
in, you'll begin onboarding by creating a Space.

Your Space is a container for your organization's distributed nodes and their respective Agents. You can name the Space
however you'd like (alphanumeric characters and hyphens only, 5-20 characters), and we recommend choosing a name
relevant to your organization or the team responsible for monitoring and troubleshooting. You can also create additional
Spaces later.

When you're done naming your Space, click **Next**.

Next, you'll create a War Room. War Rooms help you categorize your nodes and are populated the real-time metrics and
alarm information generated by the many distributed Netdata Agents running across your infrastructure.

We recommend you name your first War Room after a logical grouping of your nodes, such as **Webservers**.

When you're finished naming your War Room, click **Next** to begin the claiming process.

## Claim a node

The claiming process allows a Netdata Agent, running on a distributed node, to securely connect to Netdata Cloud. By
going through the process of claiming a node, you prove you have write and administrative access to that node, and
prevents any third party from adding your node to a Cloud account you did not authorize.

View our [node claiming documentation](/docs/agent/claim/) for details about why we implemented the claiming process and
the encryption methods we use to secure your data in transit. Netdata Cloud does not store or log the metrics or alarm
status of your Agents.

> Keep in mind that a node can only be claimed in a single Space. 



## Finish onboarding

Once you claim your node(s), click **Next** to invite members of your team to your Space.

> If you don't invite members now, you can invite them at a later time.

When you invite members to your Space, they can make changes to the War Rooms and, if they are admins, they can invite
other members to the Space. All new members are added to the **General** War Room.

Enter the email and name of the person you want to invite and click **Add (+)**. You can add as many members as you like. Select which members 


<!-- Update your agent(s): Read the documentation for instructions on how to check if you’re up-to-date, and how to update manually if not.
Visit an agent’s dashboard.
Click on the Sign in button on the top-right corner of the dashboard.
Sign in to Netdata Cloud with your preferred method: email, GitHub, or Google.
Begin the onboarding process.
Claim nodes by running the command given during the onboarding process on every Netdata agent you want to connect to Netdata Cloud.
You must run the command on every node you want to add to Netdata Cloud.
The claiming process proves you have administrative access to the node in question and connects your node to Netdata Cloud via the agent-cloud link (ACLK). Read our ACLK documentation for details about how we implemented it and keep your data safe with end-to-end encryption.
Finish onboarding and visit your Space for the first time. -->
