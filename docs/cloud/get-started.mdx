This guide will help you get started with Netdata Cloud by walking you through the onboarding and claiming process.

**The new Netdata Cloud launches on April 27, 2020.**

The following information exists as a reference for those who are interested in using Cloud upon its release and need
time to plan their approach to adopting Cloud. On April 27, we will deprecate the previous version of Netdata Cloud,
commonly referred to as **Nodes View**. Active users of Nodes View must migrate to the rearchitected Cloud by onboarding
and claiming nodes.

## Before you start

If you don't yet have the Netdata Agent installed, see our [installation guide](/docs/agent/packaging/installer/).

Before you begin Cloud onboarding, make sure to update your Agent(s) by visiting the dashboard and click the **Update**
or **Update Now** button in the top navigation. The modal will tell you whether your Agent is up-to-date or not. 

> ⚠️ Netdata Cloud requires an Agent with v1.22 or higher.

If you need to update, read the [updating documentation](/docs/agent/packaging/installer/update/) for information on how
to update based on the method you used to install that Agent.

## Begin the onboarding process

Navigate to Netdata Cloud either by clicking the **Sign in** button in a dashboard's top navigation, or by visiting
[https://app.netdata.cloud](https://app.netdata.cloud).

The Authentication screen asks you to sign in via Google, GitHub, or email. 

Once signed in, you begin onboarding by creating a Space. Your Space is a container for your organization's many
distributed nodes and their respective Agents.

You'll also create your first War Room, which helps you organize your nodes. We recommend you name your first War Room
after a logical grouping of your nodes, such as their service, purpose, or physical location. This way, you can populate
your first War Room with real-time metrics and alarm information from distributed-but-related nodes.

Once finished with creating a Space and War Room, you move into the node claiming process.

## Claim a node

The claiming process allows a Netdata Agent, running on a distributed node, to securely connect to Netdata Cloud. By
going through the process of claiming a node, you prove you have write and administrative access to that node, and
prevents any third party from adding your node to a Cloud account you did not authorize.

View our [node claiming documentation](/docs/agent/claim/) for details about why we implemented the claiming process and
the encryption methods we use to secure your data in transit. Netdata Cloud does not store or log the metrics or alarm
status of your Agents.

There are two important notes regarding claiming:

-   A single node can only be claimed in one Space, but you can add a node to as many War Rooms as you would like. This
    might affect how many Spaces you create and which nodes you add to each. 
-   You must repeat the claiming process on every node you want to add to Netdata Cloud.

Begin the claiming process by selecting which War Rooms you want to add this node to using the dropdown.

To claim a node, copy the script given by Cloud. **You must run this script as the user running the** `netdata`
**service**, which is usually the `netdata` user. You have two options: Switch to the appropriate user yourself, or run
the command using `sudo` to automatically manage permissions.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="netdata-user"
  values={[
    { label: 'netdata user', value: 'netdata-user', },
    { label: 'sudo', value: 'sudo', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="netdata-user">

```bash
sudo su -s /bin/bash netdata
netdata-claim.sh -token=TOKEN -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2 -url=https://app.netdata.cloud
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sudo">

```bash
sudo netdata-claim.sh -token=TOKEN -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2 -url=https://app.netdata.cloud
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Hit **Enter**. The script should return `Agent was successfully claimed.`. Your node may need up to 60 seconds to
connect to Netdata Cloud after finishing the claiming process. Please be patient!

Now repeat this process with every node you want to add to Cloud during onboarding. You can also add more nodes later.

### Claiming through a proxy

If your node uses a proxy to connect to the internet, you need to configure the Agent's proxy settings. See our
[claiming documentation](/docs/agent/claim/#claiming-through-a-proxy) for details.

### Troubleshooting

If the claiming script returns with a failure, or the claimed node does not appear in the onboarding screen, see our [claiming documentation](/docs/agent/claim/#troubleshooting) for troubleshooting tips.

## Finish onboarding

Once you claim your node(s), click **Next** to invite members of your team to your Space. If you don't invite members
now, you can invite them at a later time.

The onboarding process then gives you a summary of the Space and War Room you created. Click **Go to your Space** to get
started.

## What's next?

On the day of launch, we'll add more details about navigating the Cloud interface, how to organize your nodes, and how
to view all their distributed metrics in Cloud's centralized interface. Stay tuned!
