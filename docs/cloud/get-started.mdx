The following information exists as a reference for current Cloud users who are interested in using the rearchitected
Cloud experience after its April 27, 2020 release, and need to plan their approach to adopting it. The previous version
of Cloud, commonly referred to as **Nodes View**, will be deprecated on April 27.

## Before you start

Before you begin Cloud onboarding, make sure to update your Agent(s) to v1.22 or higher. Read the [updating
documentation](/docs/agent/packaging/installer/update/) for information on how to update based on the method you used to
install that Agent.

## Begin the onboarding process

Navigate to Netdata Cloud either by clicking the **Sign in** button in a dashboard's top navigation, or by visiting
[https://app.netdata.cloud](https://app.netdata.cloud).

Once signed in, you begin onboarding by creating your first Space and War Room, both of which help you organize your
team and the many systems that make up your infrastructure. For example, you can put product and infrastructure SRE
teams in separate Spaces, and then use War Rooms to group Agent-monitored nodes by their service (`nginx`), purpose
(`webservers`), or physical location (`IAD`).

Don't worryâ€”you can always add more Spaces and War Rooms later if you decide to reorganize how you use Netdata Cloud.

## Claim a node

The claiming process allows a Netdata Agent, running on a distributed node, to securely connect to Netdata Cloud. By
going through the process of claiming a node, you prove you have write and administrative access to that node. Because
no one can claim a node they don't have write and administrative access to, the claiming process ensures you remain in
full control of your nodes and their metrics.

View our [node claiming documentation](/docs/agent/claim/) for details about why we implemented the claiming process and
the encryption methods we use to secure your data in transit. Netdata Cloud does not store or log the metrics or alarm
status of your Agents.

There are two important notes regarding claiming:

-   You can only claim any given node in a single Space. You can, however, add that claimed node to multiple War Rooms
    within its Space.
-   You must repeat the claiming process on every node you want to add to Netdata Cloud.

To claim a node, select which War Rooms you want to add this node to with the dropdown, then copy the script given by
Cloud. **You must run this script as the user running the** `netdata` **service**, which is usually the `netdata` user.
You have two options: Switch to the appropriate user yourself, or run the command using `sudo` to automatically manage
permissions.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="netdata-user"
  values={[
    { label: 'netdata user', value: 'netdata-user', },
    { label: 'sudo', value: 'sudo', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="netdata-user">

```bash
sudo su -s /bin/bash netdata
netdata-claim.sh -token=TOKEN -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2 -url=https://app.netdata.cloud
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sudo">

```bash
sudo netdata-claim.sh -token=TOKEN -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2 -url=https://app.netdata.cloud
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Hit **Enter**. The script should return `Agent was successfully claimed.`. Your node may need up to 60 seconds to
connect to Netdata Cloud after finishing the claiming process. Please be patient!

Now repeat this process with every node you want to add to Cloud during onboarding. You can also add more nodes once
you've finished onboarding.

### Claim an Agent running in Docker

You can execute the claiming script to an Agent running as a Docker container, or attach the claiming script when
creating an Agent container for the first time, such as when you're spinning up ephemeral containers. See the [claim an
Agent running in Docker](/docs/agent/claim/#claiming-an-agent-running-in-docker) documentation for details.

### Claim through a proxy

If your node uses a proxy to connect to the internet, you need to configure the Agent's proxy settings. See our
[claiming through a proxy](/docs/agent/claim/#claiming-through-a-proxy) documentation for details.

### Troubleshooting

If the claiming script returns with a failure, or the claimed node does not appear in the onboarding screen, see our
[troubleshooting tips](/docs/agent/claim/#troubleshooting).

## What's next?

You finish onboarding by inviting members of your team to your Space. You can also invite them later. At this point,
you're ready to use Cloud, add more nodes, and organize the structure according to your needs.

On the day of launch, we'll add more details about navigating the Cloud interface, how to organize your nodes, and how
to view all their distributed metrics in Cloud's centralized interface. Stay tuned!
