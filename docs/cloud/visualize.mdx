With Netdata Cloud, you can visualize metrics and charts from any number of distributed nodes in one place. Set up the
[Nodes view](/docs/cloud/visualize/nodes) to show the most important metrics for your infrastructure, whether they're
system load or the volume of 404 response codes for an Nginx webserver, then dive into embedded dashboards for
instantaneous troubleshooting.

Take metrics visualization even further by building entirely [new dashboards](/docs/cloud/visualize/dashboards). Combine
any chart from any claimed node to track specific parts of your infrastructure with high granularity and real-time
metrics.
