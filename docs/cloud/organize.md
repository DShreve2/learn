Netdata Cloud uses Spaces and War Rooms to help you organize your real-time infrastructure monitoring.

If you aren't invited to Netdata Cloud by another user, you'll create your first Space and War Room during onboarding.
Nothing you create during onboarding is locked-inâ€”you can always reconfigure and tweak your Cloud experience based on
how you want to organize your team's efforts or if your infrastructure changes.

Administrators can decide whether to make Spaces and War Rooms 

Let's walk through creating new Spaces and War Rooms, and then learn some organizational strategies.

## Add Spaces

Spaces are high-level containers to help you organize your team members and nodes. You can have as many spaces as you'd
like based on how you want to organize your infrastructure monitoring in Netdata Cloud.

You can add new Spaces by clicking on the green plus icon `+` in the Spaces menu. A new menu will slide in and prompt
you for the name of this new Space.

While you can't change the name of an existing Space, you can always create additional Spaces and delete the ones you
don't want any more.

## Add War Rooms

War Rooms are where users can view key metrics in real-time and monitor the health of many nodes with their alarm
status.

You can add new War Rooms to any Space by clicking on the green plus icon `+` after the **Rooms** heading. A new menu
will slide in and promt you to name the new War Room, give it a description, and choose whether it's **public**, in that
all users of your Space will be able to join it, or private.

Once created, the War Room will appear
