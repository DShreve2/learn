Invite new users by clicking on your Space's name in the top navigation, and then **Invite more users**, to open the
invitation panel.

Enter the email addresses for the users you want to invite to your Space. You can enter any number of email addresses,
separated by a comma, to send multiple invitations at once.

Next, choose the War Rooms you want to invite these users to. Once logged in, these users are not restricted only to
these War Rooms. They can be invited to others, or join any that are public.

Click the **Send** button to send an email invitation, which will prompt to [sign in](/docs/cloud/manage/sign-in) and
join your Space.

Any unaccepted invitations remain under **Invitations awaiting response**. These invitations can be rescinded at any
time by clicking the trash can icon.
