title: Netdata Cloud
---

> ðŸŽ‰ The rearchitected Netdata Cloud goes live on April 27, 2020!

Netdata Cloud gives you real-time visibility for your entire infrastructure. With Netdata Cloud, you can run all your
distributed Agents in headless mode _and_ access the real-time metrics and insightful charts from their dashboards. View
key metrics and active alarms at-a-glance, and then seamlessly dive into any of your distributed dashboards without
leaving Cloud's centralized interface.

**Netdata Cloud is free**! You can add an entire infrastructure of nodes, invite all your colleagues, and visualize any
number of metrics, charts, and alarms entirely for free.

While Netdata Cloud offers a centralized method of monitoring your Agentsâ€”your metrics data is not stored or centralized
in any way. Metrics data remains with your nodes and is only streamed to your browser through Cloud. In addition, Cloud
only expands on the functionality of the wildly popular [free and open source Agent](/docs/agent/). We will never make
any of our open source Agent features cloud-exclusive, and we will actively continue to develop the Agent so that we can
integrate new features seamlessly with the cloud.

## Get started with Netdata Cloud
