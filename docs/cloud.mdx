title: Netdata Cloud
---

Netdata Cloud is a real-time health monitoring and performance troubleshooting platform for your entire infrastructure.
With Netdata Cloud, you can reduce the threat of of anomalies or outages by viewing all the metrics and active alarms
from any number of distributed Netdata Agents in one place.

🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
we need to make it clear that Cloud functions are free as a service now and that you need to claim each node individually.

Netdata Cloud is _forever free_, meaning you can sign in, add as many nodes as you'd like, invite as many other members
as you'd like, and configure your Spaces and War Rooms for free.

> ⚠️ Netdata Cloud is not yet live. The following information exists as a reference for those who are interested in
> using Cloud upon its release, particularly those who must migrate from the existing Nodes View.

## Get started with Netdata Cloud

Read our [Get started with Cloud](/docs/cloud/get-started/) guide to understand the process of claiming a node and
migrating from the existing Nodes View.
