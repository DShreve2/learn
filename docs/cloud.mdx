> ðŸŽ‰ The rearchitected Netdata Cloud goes live on April 27, 2020!

Netdata Cloud gives you real-time visibility for your entire infrastructure. With Netdata Cloud, you can run all your
distributed Agents in headless mode _and_ access the real-time metrics and insightful charts from their dashboards. View
key metrics and active alarms at-a-glance, and then seamlessly dive into any of your distributed dashboards without
leaving Cloud's centralized interface.

**Netdata Cloud is free**! You can add an entire infrastructure of nodes, invite all your colleagues, and visualize any
number of metrics, charts, and alarms entirely for free. When combined with our [open-source Agent](/docs/agent/),
Netdata Cloud lets you see both the big picture and every granular detail in one place.

## Get started with Netdata Cloud

Read the [get started with Cloud](/docs/cloud/get-started/) guide to understand how to migrate from the existing Nodes
View by completing onboarding and claiming nodes.
