t/k


Most Netdata Cloud users set up War Rooms based on the node's purpose or the primary application it's responsible for
running, but the strategy is entirely up to you. Some even use War Rooms for incident response, so that they can see
only affected nodes in one place and correlate metrics more efficiently.
