While [panning through time and zooming in/out](/docs/agent/dashboards/interact-chartsx) from charts is helpful when
you're looking a recent history, or want to do granular troubleshooting, what if you want to see metrics from 6 hours
ago? Or 6 days?

Netdata's dashboard features a **time & date picker** to help you visualize specific timeframes in a few helpful ways.
By default, it shows a certain number of minutes of historical metrics based on the your browser's viewport to ensure
it's always showing per-second granularity.

## Open the time & date picker

To visualize a new timeframe, you need to open the picker, which appears just above the menu, near the top-right cover
of the dashboard.

The **Clear** button resets the dashboard back to its default state based on your browser viewport, and **Apply** closes
the picker and shifts all charts to the selected timeframe.

## Use the Quick Selector

Click any of the following options in the **Quick Selector** to choose a commonly-used timeframe.

- Last 5 minutes
- Last 15 minutes
- Last 2 hours
- Last 6 hours
- Last 12 hours

Click **Apply** to see metrics from your selected timeframe.

## Choose a specific interval

Beneath the Quick Selector is an input field and dropdown you use in combination to select a specific timeframe of
minutes, hours, days, or months. Enter a number and choose the appropriate unit of time, then click **Apply**.

## Choose multiple days

Use the calendar to select multiple days. Click on a date to begin the timeframe selection, then an ending date. The
timeframe begins at noon on the beginning and end dates. Click **Apply** to see your selected multi-day timeframe.

## Caveats and considerations

**Longer timeframes will decrease metrics granularity**. If you zoom out to a window of 6 hours, for example, each "tick" on the chart will 

**You can only see metrics as far back in history as your metrics retention policy allows**. Netdata uses an internal
time-series database (TSDB) to store as many metrics as it can within a specific amount of disk space. The default
storage is 256 MiB, which should be enough for 1-3 days of historical metrics. If you navigate back to a timeframe
beyond stored historical metrics, you'll see this message:

At any time, [configure the internal TSDB's storage capacity](/docs/store/change-metrics-storage) to expand your
depth of historical metrics.

## What's next?

We recommend you dive deeper into some additional dashboard features, such as [import/exporting
snapshots](/docs/agent/dashboards/import-export-snapshotsx) or
[customization](/docs/agent/dashboards/customize-standard-dashboardx).
