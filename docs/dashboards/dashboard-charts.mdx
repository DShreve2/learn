As soon as you [install Netdata](/docs/agent/installationx), it autodetects hardware, OS, containers, services, and
applications running on your node and builds a preconfigured dashboard on a single, scrollable webpage. This page
features hundreds of charts, which are also preconfigured to save you time from learning a query language, all stacked
on top of one another to encourage exploration and help you visually identify connections between the metrics visualized
in different charts.

To maximize your post-installation Netdata experience, it's important to understand the features and functionality of
Netdata's dashboard and charts.

## The dashboard

Netdata's dashboard can be broken down into a key areas:

1. [Charts and sections](#charts-and-sections)
2. [Menu/submenus](#menu-and-submenus)
3. [Time & date picker](#time-date-picker)
4. [Replicated nodes panel](#replicated-nodes-panel)
5. [Netdata Cloud functionality](#netdata-cloud-functionality)

dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/101509403-f7e59400-3935-11eb-9abd-cbecfa3ee49a.png)

### Charts and sections

The dashboard is a single page with many charts, which are automatically organized into **sections**, such as **System
Overview**, **CPU**, **Disk**, and more. Inside each section, you'll find a number of charts, broken down into
[contexts](/docs/agent/dashboards/chart-dimensions-contexts-familiesx#contexts) and
[families](/docs/agent/dashboards/chart-dimensions-contexts-familiesx#families).

Learn more about the [anatomy of charts](#charts) below, or skip ahead to the basics of [interacting with
charts](/docs/agent/dashboards/interact-chartsx), such as panning through time, zooming in, or highlighting timeframes to
help you troubleshoot anomalies.

### Menu and submenus

The dashboard features a **menu** on the right-hand side, which is automatically populated with text and a link to every
section. Most metrics menu items will contain several **submenu** items, which oftentimes link to "subsections" of
charts. For example, the **network** submenu item links to a group of charts for system-wide network monitoring.

![A screenshot of metrics
menus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80834638-f08f2880-8ba5-11ea-99ae-f610b2885fd6.png)

Some submenu items link to the various [families](/docs/agent/dashboards/chart-dimensions-contexts-familiesx#families)
Netdata automatically creates for multiple instances of a monitored resource. For example, a **Disks** menu with several
submenu entries for each disk drive and partition.

![Screenshot of some metrics
submenus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80834697-11577e00-8ba6-11ea-979c-92fd19cdb480.png)

### Time & date picker

The dashboard features a time & date picker to help you visualize specific timeframes of historical metrics. The picker
chooses an appropriate default to always show per-second granularity based on the width of your browser's viewport.

See the doc on [picking timeframes](/docs/agent/dashboards/pick-timeframesx) for more details.

### Replicated Nodes panel

If you're using [streaming](/docs/agent/streaming), both the parent and child nodes appear in the Replicated Nodes panel,
which appears on the left-hand side of the dashboard. Click either link to switch between the various dashboards for
your streaming-enabled nodes.

![Switching between parent and child streaming
nodes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/110043346-761ec000-7d04-11eb-8e58-77670ba39161.gif)

Show or hide this panel using the **hamburger** icon (![Export
icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netdata/netdata-ui/master/src/components/icon/assets/hamburger.svg)) next to the
Netdata logo.

### Netdata Cloud functionality

Any dashboard can connect to a Netdata Cloud account to enable additional functionality, such as quickly navigating to a
[War Room](/docs/cloud/war-rooms) or moving between recently-visited dashboards.

When enabled, click on any of the War Room or Spaces to open Netdata Cloud in a new tab and jump to that location.

Jump over to the [Netdata Cloud docs](/docs/cloud/) for more details on how and why you would choose to sign up and monitor multiple nodes from a single interface.

## Charts

A **chart** is an individual, interactive, always-updating graphic displaying one or more
[dimensions](/docs/agent/dashboards/chart-dimensions-contexts-familiesx#dimensions), which are raw data or calculated
values, such as percentages, aggregates, and more.

Here's the system CPU chart, the first chart displayed on the standard dashboard:

![Screenshot of the system CPU chart in the Netdata
dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/114786663-5a5efe80-9d33-11eb-8316-4d9eec2e672f.png)

Let's break the chart down into its many parts.

### Description

![A chart

Many charts come with a short description of what dimensions the chart is displaying and why they matter. If you're new
to monitoring and troubleshooting, we recommend you spend some time reading these descriptions to learn more about why
you might care about something strange happening on a given chart and what you should do next.

### Name and context

![The name and context of a
chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/114932664-9d30dd00-9dec-11eb-9cb5-d12f83037f92.png)

Netdata displays a chart's name in parentheses above the chart. For example, if you navigate to the system CPU chart,
you'll see the label: **Total CPU utilization (system.cpu)**. In this case, the chart's name is `system.cpu`. Netdata
derives the name from the chart's [context](/docs/agent/chart-dimensions-contexts-familiesx#contexts).

### Y-axis

![A chart's axis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/114932655-9b671980-9dec-11eb-9e60-3e8b788e8461.png)

A chart's y-axis visualizes how dimensions change over time (x-axis).

Some charts have a y-axis that always begins at 0. Others scale the y-axis based on the displayed dimensions and metric
values to help you see changes with the most possible granularity. For example, the **Available RAM for applications
(mem.available)** chart scales its y-axis based on the maximum and minimum values displayed over the current timeframe.
If the maximum is `4.85` and the minimum is `4.23`, then the y-axis is scaled between those two values.

`read`, `input`, `inbound`, `received` dimensions are displayed as positive values, while `write`, `output`, `outbound`,
`sent` are displayed as negative values.

In addition, a zero-based `stacked` chart automatically switches to an auto-scaled `area` chart when you select a single
dimension.

### Timetamp

![timestamp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/114932667-9dc97380-9dec-11eb-9434-5195bee5cc95.png)

When charts are automatically updating, this timestamp shows the last data collection. You'll most often see the
timestamps ticking up every second, which makes sense, given that most metrics are queries, collected, and visualized
every second. When you hover over the chart, the timestamp shows that value's timestamp.

### Legend

![A chart's
legend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/114932663-9c984680-9dec-11eb-8ab7-c6a56487c765.png)

The legend displays every dimension visualized in the chart. 

When charts are auto-updating, the legend shows the latest value for each dimension. When you hover over the chart,
you'll instead see the value associated with that timestamp.

Learn more about [interacting with dimensions](/docs/agent/dashboards/interact-chartsx#show-hide-dimensions).

### Interactions

![interactions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/114932661-9c984680-9dec-11eb-894e-1210077ab337.png)

These interactions are, respectively, `Pan Left`, `Reset`, `Pan Right`, `Zoom In`, and `Zoom Out`.

There's other, more intuitive ways to interact with charts, such as panning the mouse, or zooming with the
scrollwheel/touchpad. See the [interact with charts](/docs/agent/dashboards/interact-chartsx) doc for a full listing of
interactions and their associated keyboard shortcuts.

## What's next?

Now that you have the lay of the land in Netdata's dashboard, we recommend learning more about [chart
interactions](/docs/agent/dashboards/interact-chartsx). From there, learn how to use the [time & date
picker](/docs/agent/dashboards/pick-timeframesx), or jump ahead to [configuring your node](/docs/configure/nodes).
